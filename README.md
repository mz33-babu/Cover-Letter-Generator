# Cover-Letter-Generator
Cover Letter Generator leveraging on GPT3

The Cover Letter Generator is a Python-based project that leverages the Streamlit library to automate the process of writing cover letters. By utilizing the power of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, this project generates personalized cover letters based on the user's CV (Curriculum Vitae) and job description.

# Features
CV and Job Description Input: Users can upload their CV and provide the job description for which they are applying.
GPT Model Integration: The project integrates the GPT model, a state-of-the-art language model, to generate natural and coherent cover letter content.
Personalized Cover Letters: The generated cover letters are tailored to the individual's qualifications and skills mentioned in their CV, as well as the specific requirements outlined in the job description.
Customization Options: Users have the ability to customize certain aspects of the cover letter, such as the tone, language style, and formatting, to align with their preferences.
User-friendly Interface: The project utilizes the Streamlit library to create a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to input their CV and job description and generate a cover letter with just a few interactions.
How It Works
CV and Job Description Input: Users upload their CV and provide the job description details through the Streamlit interface.
Data Processing: The CV and job description data are processed and pre-processed to extract relevant information and ensure compatibility with the GPT model.
Cover Letter Generation: The GPT model analyzes the CV and job description inputs and generates a personalized cover letter that highlights the user's qualifications and aligns with the job requirements.
Customization: Users have the option to customize the generated cover letter by selecting different tones, language styles, and formatting options.
Review and Finalize: Users can review the generated cover letter, make any necessary adjustments, and finalize the cover letter for submission.
